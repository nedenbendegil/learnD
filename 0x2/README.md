This weeks contents:

``[1]`` Garbage collection\
Uhh so you have to call the garbage collecto to wakeup manually. On the `learnGC.d` file you can understand how it works.\

``[2]`` Struct\
Structs are all copy by value, not reference\


You can also use this(...) to init the struct
private funcs can not be called outside in structs
when you define const you can not edit the members
static can only get static but can be called without initializing object
static can call other static functions
when you say auto p = new Person(..) it is created on STACK
but when you use the `new` it is created on HEAP
